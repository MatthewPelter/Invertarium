			Sometimes a <a href="">board</a> is all you need to sturdy a foundation. A nail is meant to hold things together, not tear them apart. If you only ever focus on the water you can't remove from the flood, you'll never realize the things not drenched. Be the energy you want to attract. Remember that everyone is doing their best, even if you can't understand. Sometimes you miss your payload, but the next one is worth trying again. Inserting motivational text rahter than lorem ipsum is more inspiring and motivating. Behind every dog is a tail. If you never tie your laces, you are sure to trip. Love life like your dog does; with forgiveness and aspirations. Remember those who remember you. It is better to give than to receive. If all else fails, laugh at yourself. No one is inherently good or bad. All broken things can be repurposed, even if it's for another use. When life is shitty, flush the toilet. Lose yourself in the music.<br /><br />
